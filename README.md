This is Accenture Data Analytics Virtual Experience I completed. The goal was to help a company named “Social Buzz”. Social Buzz is a fast growing technology unicorn that need to adapt quickly to its global scale. Accenture began a 3 – month POC focusing on these tasks:

1.      An audit of social buzz’s big data practice.

2.      Recommendation for a successful IPO.

3.      Analysis to find social buzz’s top 5 most popular categories of content.



I worked as a data analyst with Accenture in the Analytic team to deliver high quality insights from raw data and turning it into business decisions.

How I tackled the problem:

1.      Data Understanding.

2.      Data Cleaning.

3.      Data Modeling.

4.      Data Analysis.

5.      Generate Insights to unlock business decisions.

6.      Present to the client
